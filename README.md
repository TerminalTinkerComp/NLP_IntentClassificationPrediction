# NLP_IntentClassificationPrediction
This Python code trains a machine learning model to classify sentences into different intents. It uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical features and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a sentence is a question, statement, or advice.
